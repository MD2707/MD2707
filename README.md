 I am Mathias Duprat ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· , I am 20 years old and I am 2nd year student at computer science BUT (bac +3 diploma) at the iut of Bordeaux.
 During my course I developed a strong interest in full-stack web development:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JS
 - PHP (Symfony)

My ambition is to join a small team made up of different and complementary profiles as a web developer.

Hunter and fisherman in my spare time, I like the calm and simplicity that nature gives off.
I have values of respect and responsibility that I know how to apply in my work and I like to share my experiences and learn from others.
